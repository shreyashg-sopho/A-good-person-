I am a softeare engineer by profession and even though I did study the same in university, I was struggling early on in my career.

My mentor onde day though in a slightly furious tone, gave me an advice to approach a problem :

If you feels your problems are unique, 99% of the times you are wrong.
Any problem that you are facing, atleast another 20% people have faced the same problem.
Out of those 20% people, almost all have been able to fix the problem.
Out of those 20%, someone most have written something on it on the internet or must have a mention of it somewhere in a book, or someone you know must have sufered through the same. 

If there are so many people wh have been able to solve the problem, you will to. 
Either by just knowing that it is solvable, or by knowing that the solution is already out there with someone or something.
You need to trust that if everyone else has been able to solve it, so can you !
