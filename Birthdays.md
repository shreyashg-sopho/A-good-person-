Birthdays : 

Childhood memories. 
Awkard in late teens and young adulthood.  (introspection (mostly me) and also one day where you all of a sudden get all the attention.) 
Adulthood now : Comfortable, I understand that it is a day for people to celebrate me. I should be welcoming to them wanting to me around that day. World is busy right now, if osmoene is making time for you for a dya, you are porobably a meaningful soul to them.


Birthday parties ?
as in 20 people vs 5 people etc..if needed.
