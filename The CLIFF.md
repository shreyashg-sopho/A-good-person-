# The CLIFF Rating

**C - Career**  
**L - Love**  
**I - Identity**  
**F - Family**  
**F - Friends**

I always wondered if there was a very simple way to measure how things are going in life emotionally.  
Something that signals you that *“hey, you must be cautious, some things that are very close/important to you are at risk”* or something that tells you *“this is probably the sweetest spot of my life.”*

Well, being fully aware of everything in the present is quite difficult, and that’s exactly why I came up with a method for myself called the **CLIFF rating.**

## The Idea  
Life in adulthood, for most of us, revolves around five key pillars: **Career, Love, Identity, Family, and Friends.**  
If you pause and give each of these a color **Green, Yellow, or Red** you’ll instantly get a picture of where you stand.  

No numbers, no overthinking. Just a simple color check.  
And honestly, doing it **once a month** is more than enough.

---

## Career
- **Green** → You feel stable and content. Finances are fine, the environment is peaceful, colleagues are supportive, and overall, work feels fulfilling.  
- **Yellow** → You feel the need to move on because something important is missing. Be it growth, recognition, or satisfaction.  
- **Red** → You’re deeply worried about your career, whether due to instability, dissatisfaction, or stress.

---

## Love
- **Green** → You feel warmth and connection. This could be in the form of a healthy romantic relationship, deep companionship, or simply self-love where you feel at peace with yourself. There is trust, care, and emotional safety in this area of life.  
- **Yellow** → Love is present, but not at its best. The bond may feel a little distant, routine, or uncertain at times. You may wish for more communication, effort, or depth, but the foundation is still intact. It’s less about things being “broken” and more about a gentle reminder that this area needs attention and nurturing.   
- **Red** → It feels broken, absent, or deeply unfulfilling. You may feel neglected, unloved, or completely disconnected from a partner, from people you care about, or even from yourself. This could show up as loneliness, repeated conflict, or simply an empty space where love should be.  


*(Note: Love is not necessarily romantic. Even if you’re not in a relationship right now, that does not automatically mean Red.)*

---

## Identity
- **Green** → You feel authentic, aligned with your values, and comfortable in your own skin. Those around you generally accept you for who you are.  
- **Yellow** → You’re questioning yourself, or unhappy with a certain part of who you are.  
- **Red** → You feel completely disconnected from yourself, unsure of who you are or what you stand for.

---

## Family
- **Green** → Bonds are strong and supportive.  
- **Yellow** → Things are slightly shaky, or you’re worried or concerned about a family member.  
- **Red** → Ties feel strained, distant, or absent.  

---

## Friends
- **Green** → You have people you can lean on and be your true self with.  
- **Yellow** → Friendships feel surface-level; you have some people around, but you can’t fully be yourself.  
- **Red** → You feel lonely, isolated, and disconnected.

## Reading Your CLIFF
When you step back and look at your CLIFF colors, the pattern is revealing:  

- A couple of **Yellows** → That’s okay—you’re aware and can adjust.  
- A single **Red** → A signal to pay attention.  
- Three or more **Reds** → You’re on the edge of the **CLIFF**—unstable, anxious, or overwhelmed.  

That’s the beauty of it. The CLIFF rating doesn’t need numbers, journals, or daily tracking.  
Just colors. Quick, honest, and visual.  

And when all five are **Green**—or mostly Green with a touch of Yellow—you know you’re standing on solid ground, maybe even at one of the sweetest spots in your life.

## Final Note
The CLIFF is flexible. You can **add or remove categories** to suit your life.  

For example:  
- Add **Health** if it matters to you deeply.  
- Remove **Love** if you’re not in a phase of life where it’s a concern.  

The key is to check in with yourself **once a month** and adjust.  
Green, Yellow, Red—it might just be the simplest way to steer yourself back into balance.
