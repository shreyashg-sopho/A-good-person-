### **The Weight of Being Good**

*From the book: "The Quiet Strength: Holding On to Who You Are in a World That Keeps Pulling"*

Being good is important. Not in the loud, performative way that gets claps and praise—but in the quiet, persistent kind of way that defines the person you are when no one is watching.

But here's the truth no one tells you:
The **benchmark of “good enough”** is elusive. It shifts with context, with people’s expectations, with the version of yourself you woke up as today. What felt like enough yesterday suddenly feels small today. And what you managed to do easily last week now feels impossible.

To be good—**consistently** good—is a burden that even the strongest grow tired of carrying.
And there are days, long days, where you might feel like giving up on it entirely.

Not because you don't believe in goodness.
Not because you’ve turned cold.
But because holding yourself to a quiet moral standard, in a loud and often cruel world, can wear you thin.

And yet... some don’t give up.

I have deep **respect for those who, despite everything stacked against them, still try.**
They drag themselves through doubt, pain, and exhaustion—and still choose to be kind. Still choose to be honest. Still choose to be patient.
Not because it’s easy. Not because they’re saints.
But because they know who they want to be.

And I have just as much **respect for those who stumble.**
For the ones who lose their temper.
Who lie sometimes.
Who shut down.
But then—catch themselves.
Apologize. Reflect. Try again.
They don’t let the fall define them.
They let the return speak for them.

That—*that*—is what goodness really looks like.

So how do you deal with the days you feel like giving up on being good?

You **remember that goodness is not perfection.**
You remember that your worth is not erased by a single failure.
You breathe. You pause.
And you ask yourself—not, “Was I perfect today?” but:

> **“Did I return to the kind of person I want to be?”**

If the answer is yes—even after failing—you are already doing more than most.

If the answer is no—there’s still time.
There is *always* still time.

Being good isn’t about being flawless.
It’s about **choosing, again and again, to return to yourself.**

That’s the kind of strength the world truly needs.
And it’s already in you.
